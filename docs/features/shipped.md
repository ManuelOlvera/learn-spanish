# Shipped features

## 2026-07-10 — "¿Dónde está…?" quiz + per-deck choice screen

**For:** both kids — the 5-year-old pre-reader *and* the 8-year-old early
reader (first slice of `docs/features/roadmap.md`; kid profiles were cut,
so difficulty is picked per-play).

**What shipped:** Tapping a deck now lands on a picture-only choice screen —
📖 *Las tarjetas* (flashcards, moved to `/deck/[id]/learn`), 👂 *Escucha*
(hear the word, tap the right picture from 2 giant choices), 🔤 *Lee* (read
the word, tap the right picture from 4). Right answer speaks the word, turns
the sticker lime, and advances; wrong answer wobbles and lets the kid retry.
Quizzes are 8 rounds (shuffled, no repeated answer, same-deck distractors),
end on the 🎉 *¡Muy bien!* screen, and reshuffle on replay.

**Where:** quiz assembly is a pure domain service in `packages/core`
(`domain/quiz.ts`: `createQuiz`, injectable `RandomSource`, typed
`QuizDeckTooSmallError`); UI in `apps/web` (`QuizPlayer.tsx`, routes
`/deck/[deckId]` → choice, `…/learn`, `…/quiz/[listen|read]`). Content tests
now also pin per-deck emoji uniqueness (quiz choices are picture-only).

## 2026-07-10 — Numbers to 100

Two new decks extend counting past ten: **Los números 11–20** (once → veinte,
complete) and **Las decenas** (diez → cien by tens — the age-appropriate way to
"count to 100"; in-between numbers are compositional in Spanish and deferred).
Visuals are composed keycap emoji (4️⃣0️⃣), cien gets 💯. The 1–10 deck was
renamed "Los números 1–10". Pack is now 6 decks / 64 words; content tests pin
both sequences and a 10–15 cards-per-deck kid-sized bound.

## 2026-07-10 — Flashcards v1 (the founding slice)

**For:** pre-readers (ages 3–5) on a shared family tablet — no accounts, no reading required.

**What shipped:** Category picker (`/`) → flashcard loop (`/deck/[deckId]`).
Four starter decks — Los animales, Los colores, Los números, La comida — 44
words total, each card a large emoji + the Spanish word (nouns carry their
article). Tapping the card speaks the word via browser speech synthesis
(`es-MX` preferred, any `es-*` voice as fallback) and wobbles it; a lime next
button advances; finishing a deck lands on a 🎉 *¡Muy bien!* screen with
replay/home. Design: **Sticker Book** (see `docs/skills/frontend-design.md`).

**Where:** content + use cases in `packages/core`
(`StaticDeckRepository`, `ListDecksUseCase`, `GetDeckUseCase`); UI and the
speech adapter in `apps/web`; wiring in `apps/web/src/lib/container.ts`.

**Deferred (not dropped):** quizzes/games, per-kid profiles & progress,
streaks/rewards, voice recording, Supabase/auth, Android TWA shell, parent
content editing.
